# PyLadies Snake 🐍 #

## Description ##

[_Snake_](wikipedia_snake) is a notoriously known game. It is also one of the homework
[projects](pyladies_snake) in the PyLadies [course](pyladies_ostrava) in Ostrava.

This repository is my try on programming this game. Its purpose is not to make it fast,
effective or in an easy way, but to exercise my brain a bit on how to do it elegantly or
to leverage some interesting concepts.

## How to run ##

### Requirements ###

* Python 3.7 – `brew install python`
* Pipenv – `pip install pipenv`

### Running ###

* `pipenv install`
* **`pipenv run snake.py`**

🐍

### Testing ###

There are no tests. (Yet?) Shame on me!
